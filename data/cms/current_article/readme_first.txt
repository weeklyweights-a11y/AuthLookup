To view the downloadable database (csv) file(s),  use a basic text editor like Notepad for simple viewing and basic edits. For a more structured approach, you can use a spreadsheet application like Google Sheets or LibreOffice Calc and import the CSV, which will parse the data into columns and rows, making it more readable. 

NOTE:  Some of the information within the .csv file(s) may contain HTML tags (e.g., : &#, #, <br>, <b>, <i>, <ul>, <li>). These HTML tags are intentionally included in the documents to affect how the text is displayed on a web page. Within the csv file, to help with parsing, the columns are delineated by commas, and the text qualifier is a double quote. When using screen reading software, please be aware of these characters when going through the data.
