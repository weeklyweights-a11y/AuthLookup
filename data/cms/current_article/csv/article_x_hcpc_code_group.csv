<p><strong>Per CPT 2026 guidance SRT should not be reported in conjunction with megavoltage (MeV) (77402, 77407, 77412).</strong></p>
<p><strong> To bill electronic brachytherapy treatment delivery use CPT code 77437 (e.g., electronic brachytherapy). When billing 77437 for SRT treatment delivery services covered by the LCD providers must append the KX modifier. </strong></p>
<p><strong>For SRT treatment planning and simulation aided field setting use CPT code 77436.</strong></p>
<p>CPT 77436 is not typically repeated with each treatment except when clinically indicated and documentation supports additional simulation requirements. Do not report clinical treatment planning (77261, 77262, 77263), simulation (77280, 77285, 77290, 77295), basic dosimetry calculation (77300), special dosimetry (77331), treatment devices (77332, 77333, 77334), isodose planning (77306, 77307, 77316, 77317, 77318), or radiation treatment management (77427, 77431, 77432, 77435, 77469, 77470, 77499) in conjunction with 77436 and 77437.</p>
<p>Code 77336 can only be billed when medically necessary for treatment adjustments in support of the radiation oncologist or other health care qualified professional.</p>
<p>Code 77370 is to be used when the complexity of the treatment plan is great. It is not expected that code 77370 will be reported for SRT services.</p>
<p>Use of 77370 with SRT code 77437 may lead to medical review.</p>",2026-01-08 18:08:49.030000000
