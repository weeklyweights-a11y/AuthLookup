Rewrite these prior authorization requirements into clear, actionable bullets that clinic staff can understand and use.

Use plain language. Avoid dense legal or policy wording.

- documentation_required = What documents or notes staff need to collect from the chart or provider
- medical_necessity_criteria = What clinical indications support approval (what the patient needs to have)
- common_denial_reasons = What will cause a denial (so staff know what to avoid or document)

Input (raw policy text):
{requirements_json}

Return ONLY a JSON object (no other text) with the same structure, rewritten for staff:
{{
  "documentation_required": ["clear item 1", "clear item 2", ...],
  "medical_necessity_criteria": ["clear criteria 1", ...],
  "common_denial_reasons": ["clear reason 1", ...]
}}

Keep each bullet short (under 100 characters when possible). Use active language staff can act on.
